# BookTracker

### Description and Motivation

Continuous learning, upskilling and reskilling are becoming ubiquitous.
The amount of information and books available is growing faster every day.
Our attention has become a commodity, and it is becoming harder to focus on long term goals.
All this affects the way we read books.


You find a book that you think is interesting, but you forget about it because something else comes up.
You start reading a book, but you don't finish it, and you forget you did not finish it.
You want to share what you are reading with others. Are they reading the same book? What are their thoughts about it?


**BookTracker** lets you track the books that you are currently reading and the books you have finished reading.
You can also have a wishlist with the books that you would like to read in the future.
It is possible to add books manually or by scanning a bar code.
You can also share that you have started reading a book, or your thoughts about it on social networks like Twitter.
